# Audience Explorer Dasboard app

The near-term  goal is to have this running as a static app on S3 bucket.
The long-term goal is to turn it into an additional chart component within the Omni app.  


### To run:
- Download the repo  
- `cd` into the `data` folder, and create a folder for each target audience, naming
the folders `target_aud_<audience-id>`.
For example, for the two sample audiences generated by the included sql scripts,
make the folders `target_aud_1` and `target_aud_2`.  
- In each of those folders, create an `audience.json` file, with the following
contents:  
```
{
  "id": <audience-id>,
  "name": "<audience-display-name>"
}  
```
For example, for the two sample audiences, put the following contents into their
respective audience.json files:  
In `data/target_aud_1`:  
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "New Car Buyers"
}
```  
In `data/target_aud_2`:  
```
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Nissan Competitive Set"
}
```  

- Now run the SQL scripts in the sql folder, making sure that the output they
create is in the `data/target_aud_<audience-id>` folders.  

- In terminal, run the following command to start a local webserver: `python -m http.server`.  

- In browser (Chrome preferred), go to http://0.0.0.0:8000/
